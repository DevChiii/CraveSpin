    <p class="text-[#2E4057] text-lg mb-8 px-6 leading-relaxed">
      Welcome to CraveSpin! We know how tough it can be to decide what to eat when you're constantly craving food but can't pick. That's why we created CraveSpin – a fun and interactive app to help you choose your next meal. Whether you're in the mood for something spicy, sweet, or savory, CraveSpin suggests food options based on your mood and location.

    <h2 class="text-[#2E4057] text-3xl font-semibold mb-6">How It Works</h2>
    <p class="text-[#2E4057] text-lg mb-8 px-6 leading-relaxed">
      Simply input your location, mood, and the weather, and CraveSpin will show you a spinning list of food options. The list spins and randomly selects one, which will then appear in the center of the screen. It's like a fun, interactive game that helps you make food decisions based on how you feel and what's happening around you. No more endless scrolling or decision fatigue – just fun food choices!
